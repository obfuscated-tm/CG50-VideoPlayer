Heavily inspired by: https://github.com/oxixes/bad-apple-cg50   

Used PrismSDK to compile: https://github.com/Jonimoose/libfxcg   

Do: compress.py (video)   
to convert video into binary readable by the video_player   

Then, put the video_player.g3a and video.bin into the root of your calculator   


NOTE:   
Currently there is no way to exit the player when video is playing (will exit when finished)
