Heavily inspired by: https://github.com/oxixes/bad-apple-cg50   

Used PrismSDK to compile: https://github.com/Jonimoose/libfxcg   

Conversion (video must be a small size like 128x72 @ 15 fps with a run length of a few mins to be able to fit into calculator storage):      
To convert, do: ```compress.py (mp4 file)``` to make video into binary readable by the video_player   
4 color palette settings are included   


Then, put the **video_player.g3a** and **video.bin** into the root of your calculator   


NOTE:   
Makefile is included if you want to compile it yourself
